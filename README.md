# usb_emulator

This project involves creating a HID Device Emulator, namely mouse and keyboard. 

We will send commands via COM to the Microcontroller, which will receive, process then execute them. 

e.g. Using a python script, we command the emulated mouse to scroll up/ scroll down. 
e.g. Using a keyboard, we command the emulated keyboard to type 'Hello World'
